Contributions to the flextable Gallery are very welcome. To contribute an article:

- you create an R Markdown containing code along with a explanation
- Add the content of your R Markdown document and eventually needed files in a 
new issue on github [here](https://github.com/ardata-fr/flextable-gallery/issues/new?template=new-example.md&title=new%20example). 
- we help polishing things if needed
