How to get a flextable from a GAM model by calling `as_flextable`.

<!--more-->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
library(flextable)
require("mgcv")
```

This example is using material from https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/chapter1

## The data

```{r}
source("mpg.R")
head(mpg)
```

## The GAM model

```{r}
mod_city3 <- gam(
  city.mpg ~ s(weight, by = drive) + s(length, by = drive) + s(price, by = drive) + drive,
  data = mpg, method = "REML")
```

## The flextable

```{r}
ft <- as_flextable(mod_city3)
ft
```


```{r include=FALSE, eval=!file.exists(here::here("static/img/flextable-imgs/flextable-002.png"))}
save_as_image(ft, path = here::here("static/img/flextable-imgs/flextable-002.png"), webshot = "webshot2")
```
